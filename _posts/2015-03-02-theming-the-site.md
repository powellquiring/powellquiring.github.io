Mine was done using [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.

- git cloned [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde.git) and copied the contents into my git repository
- went through all of the files in the root and adjusted them to be about my site
- removed the existing _posts and added my content following the same file format
- adjusted the index.html file to be to my liking
