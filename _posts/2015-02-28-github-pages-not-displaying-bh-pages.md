The content in the `gh-pages` branch are not being processed and displayed on my site.

I missed [User & Organization Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)
text.  These pages process the `master` branch not the `gh-pages` branch.

Thanks to Scott Sanicki and the great support at github.com
