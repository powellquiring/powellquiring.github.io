Buy a domain name from a registrar.
I used [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com).
On the godaddy site find Domains > Manage my domains > CName (Alias).
Configure the Host: `blog` to `Points To` YOU.github.io

This can take a while so be patient.

Do not forget to commit a CNAME file to your site that has the contents `blog.YOU.com`
